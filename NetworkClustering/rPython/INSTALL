LINUX AND UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS
===========================

Package rPython depends on Python (>= 2.7).

It requires both Python and its headers and libraries. These can be found in python and
python-dev packages in Debian-like Linux distributions.

In systems where several Python versions coexist, the user can choose the Python version
to use at installation time. By default, the package will be installed using the Python
version given by

$ python --version

but it is possible to select a different one if the RPYTHON_PYTHON_VERSION environment 
variable is appropriately set.

For instance, if it is defined as

RPYTHON_PYTHON_VERSION=3.2

it will try to use Python 3.2 (looking for python3.2 and python3.2-config in the path). If
set to

RPYTHON_PYTHON_VERSION=3

it will install against the "canonical" Python version in the system within the 3.x branch.



WINDOWS SYSTEMS
===============

On a Windows system, the package can only be installed from source at this time. Details to 
come.
