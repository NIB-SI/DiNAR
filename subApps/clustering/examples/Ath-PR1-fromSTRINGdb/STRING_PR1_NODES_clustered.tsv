AT3G25070	RPM1 interacting protein 4; Essential regulator of plant defense, which plays a central role in resistance in case of infection by a pathogen. It is a common target for both type III avirulence proteins from P.syringae (AvrB, AvrRpm1 and AvrRpt2) and for the plant Resistance (R) proteins RPM1 and RPS2. In strains carrying the appropriate R gene for avirulence proteins of the pathogen, its association with avirulence proteins triggers a defense system including the hypersensitive response, which limits the spread of disease. In contrast, in plants lacking appropriate R genes, its associ [...]	RIN4	-	1	2	3	starNet_2_1	3.14073546743268	-5.4181741525719	8	6	6	TRUE	1
